MidiMitra
=========

This projects aims to create a MIDI-Shotgun (Mitra, in italian). When the button is pressed Arduino starts sending MIDI notes to the soundcard:
if the distance from the ultrasonic sensor changes also the note changes, if you turn the potentiometer you can also alter the output frequency.

There is also a led... but just for fun :)
